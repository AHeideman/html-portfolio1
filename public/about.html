<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Allen Heideman. I love to create and design all types of things! I have been an artist all of my life. Now I am 
  bringing my designing skills into the tech field. I can't wait to design your very own custom website for you by 
  bringing forth your idea and giving it life! This portfolio site showcases my first two completed projects that I
  made using basic html only coding. I wish to develop a solid coding foundation to develop apps and software to 
  help people.</p>

<p>I also am a professional tattoo/fine artist. I will also include works and websites of my tattoos and paintings that
  I've made. I have been in art and drawn all of my life. I remember going into tattoo shops with my uncle from when I 
  was at an early age and being mesmorized by the magic of it all. Contact me to create yopur own magic on your skin or
 hang a beautiful custom painting on your wall.</p>

<p>In addition to art, my hobbies include music, playing guitar, and training Muay Thai!</p>
